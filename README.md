# UnityIngameConsole
    
An updated version of bboysil's awnser on the Unity Forum  
https://discussions.unity.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-view-the-console-in-a-build/22279  

This version uses UI toolkit for integration with new versions of unity.
Similar to bboysil's version, this version also logs to a file, however only 30 files will be stored, with the oldest being deleted when 30 files are reached.

The modes shown in the console are colour corrected for easier identification.

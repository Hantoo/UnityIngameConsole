# UnityIngameConsole
    
An updated version of bboysil's awnser on the Unity Forum  
https://discussions.unity.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-view-the-console-in-a-build/22279  

This version uses UI toolkit for integration with new versions of unity.
Similar to bboysil's version, this version also logs to a file, however only 30 files will be stored, with the oldest being deleted when 30 files are reached.
Timings also included in log.

The modes shown in the console are colour corrected for easier identification.
